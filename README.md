# Project-Kappa: Real-Time Data Engineering and Sentiment Analysis Pipeline

## Overview

**Project-Kappa** demonstrates the construction of a robust real-time data engineering pipeline using cutting-edge tools and technologies. The project processes streaming data in real time, performs sentiment analysis with OpenAI's ChatGPT, and ensures efficient data indexing and querying with Elasticsearch. 

This repository provides a step-by-step guide, codebase, and configuration to build and execute the pipeline.

## Features

- **Data Streaming**: Stream data in real-time using TCP/IP sockets.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Leverage Apache Spark for scalable and distributed data processing.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT for advanced sentiment analysis.
- **Data Streaming**: Publish processed data to Apache Kafka topics.
- **Indexing and Querying**: Utilize Elasticsearch for efficient data storage and querying.

## Technology Stack

### Programming Language
- Python 3.x

### Libraries
- `openai`: Integrates OpenAI's language models for sentiment analysis.
- `pyspark`: Provides a Python interface for Apache Spark.
- `confluent_kafka`: Facilitates real-time data streaming with Apache Kafka.
- `fastavro`: Ensures efficient serialization/deserialization for Avro schema-based data.

### Tools and Frameworks
- **Apache Spark**: Scalable real-time data processing.
- **Apache Kafka**: Real-time

messaging and data streaming platform.  
- **Elasticsearch**: Enables efficient data indexing and querying for analysis and visualization.
